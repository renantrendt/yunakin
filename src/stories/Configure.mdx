# Codepilot UI
Hi, welcome to the Codepilot UI's Storybook.

This is a living style guide for the Codepilot UI. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as we add more components.

The Codepilot UI is a React component library that is used to build the Codepilot web app. It is built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It's meant to be clean and simple, and to be used in conjunction with the Codepilot API.

The components are simple and voluntarily lightweight, as it is expected that the user will add their own styling and functionality to them. The components are meant to be used as building blocks, and not as a complete solution.

This Storybook follow Atomic Design principles, and is divided into 4 sections: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms and Templates.

## Atoms
Atoms are the smallest building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

## Molecules
Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

## Organisms
Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

## Sections
Sections are page layouts that are used to create the structure of a page. They are the highest level of abstraction and usually show the skeletal framework of the design.
